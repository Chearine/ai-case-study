# Canva AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

This case study is on the design and visual communication platform, Canva. This company has recently come out with a suite of AI design features called Magic Studio. 

Canva, an Australian company, was founded in 2013 by three individuals:  [^1]
* Melanie Perkins
* Cliff Obrecht
* Cameron Adams

The founders' vision for creating Canva was to "empower everyone to design anything, no matter their skills or experience". [^2]
AI is now enabling them to expand their vision by making it easier than ever for someone to create designs with no experience at all. 

An easy to use interface, easy access to millions of stock images, templates, and ability to collaborate are some of the reasons this company has over 100 million people in 190 countries using its platform every month. [^3] 

## Business Activities

Canva's intended customers are mainly individuals who are creating marketing and other profesional materials for their company. One of the key features this platform has is allowing users to create a brand profile, called a Brand Kit. The user is able to add guidelines for a "brand voice", characteristics they want to convey in company communications. Then using AI, they're able to apply the brand voice to any text or generate brand-friendly text based on prompts. 

Canva makes design and marketing more accessible. You no longer need a huge team of professional designers and writers to create effective, consistant, engaging material. 

Canva has competitors that are also integrating AI into design creation. One major competitor is Adobe Creative Cloud Express. Adobe is a company that has launched some of the biggest digital design platforms in history, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Adobe CC Express is meant to be a more accesible version of their software, which requires in depth training and experience to produce professional level material. Canva is still arguibly more accessible and easier to use than Adobe CC Express. Canva also has more robust AI features than Adobe CC Express. For example, Adobe does not have a feature comparible to Canva's 'Magic Switch' which allows the user to seamlessly resize their design with the click of a button. Canva is also more generous when it comes to how much you can use their AI tools. [^4]  

Canva's "Magic Studio" AI feature, which assists users in creating designs by suggesting layouts, elements, and other design components, likely utilizes a combination of advanced technologies. While the specific details of Canva's proprietary technology stack aren't publicly disclosed, we can speculate on some of the technologies involved based on industry trends and known capabilities:

* Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI): Canva likely employs various machine learning algorithms and AI techniques to analyze user inputs, understand design preferences, and generate design suggestions. This could involve natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user descriptions or requests, image recognition to understand content, and generative algorithms to create design elements.

* Image Processing and Computer Vision: Canva probably uses advanced image processing techniques and computer vision technology to analyze images uploaded by users and extract meaningful information. This could include object recognition, scene understanding, and semantic segmentation to identify elements within images and suggest relevant design elements.

* Data Analytics: Canva collects extensive user data, including design preferences, usage patterns, and engagement metrics. Data analytics tools are likely used to analyze this data and derive insights that inform the development of AI-driven features like Magic Studio. This data-driven approach helps Canva understand user behavior and preferences, improving the accuracy and relevance of design suggestions.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP technologies may be employed to analyze and understand text inputs from users, such as descriptions or keywords provided when requesting design assistance. NLP algorithms help Canva interpret user intent and generate relevant design suggestions based on the input provided.

* Cloud Computing: Canva's AI-powered features likely leverage cloud computing resources to perform computationally intensive tasks such as image processing, machine learning model inference, and data analysis. Cloud-based infrastructure provides scalability and flexibility, allowing Canva to handle varying levels of user demand and continuously improve its AI capabilities.

* User Interaction and Feedback Mechanisms: Canva may incorporate user interaction data and feedback mechanisms into its AI algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of design suggestions over time. By analyzing how users interact with suggested designs and incorporating feedback, Canva can refine its AI models to better meet user needs and preferences. design best practices are likely incorporated into the development process to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

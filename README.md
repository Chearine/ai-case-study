# Canva AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

This case study is on the design and visual communication platform, Canva. This company has recently come out with a suite of AI design features called Magic Studio. 

Canva, an Australian company, was founded in 2013 by three individuals:  [^1]
* Melanie Perkins
* Cliff Obrecht
* Cameron Adams

The founders' vision for creating Canva was to "empower everyone to design anything, no matter their skills or experience". [^2]
AI is now enabling them to expand their vision by making it easier than ever for someone to create designs with no experience at all. 

An easy to use interface, easy access to millions of stock images, templates, and ability to collaborate are some of the reasons this company has over 100 million people in 190 countries using its platform every month. [^3] 

## Business Activities

Canva's intended customers are mainly individuals who are creating marketing and other profesional materials for their company. One of the key features this platform has is allowing users to create a brand profile, called a Brand Kit. The user is able to add guidelines for a "brand voice", characteristics they want to convey in company communications. Then using AI, they're able to apply the brand voice to any text or generate brand-friendly text based on prompts. 

Canva makes design and marketing more accessible. You no longer need a huge team of professional designers and writers to create effective, consistant, engaging material. 

Canva has competitors that are integrating AI into design creation. One major competitor is Adobe Creative Cloud Express. Adobe is a company that has launched some of the biggest digital design platforms in history, such as Photoshop. Adobe CC Express is supposted to be a more accesible version of their software, which requires in depth training and experience to produce professional level material. 
Someone with basic computer skills can visit the Canva site and get comparible results in minutes. Canva also has AI features that Adobe CC Express does not, such as  ‘Magic Switch’, which allows the user to seemlessly resize their design with one click.
